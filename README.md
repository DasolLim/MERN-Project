*Admin has ability to disable/enable users and delete all lists created by all users*

## Overview:
*The goal? To blend server-side and client-side scripting, using Node.js for the backend and a front-end framework*

## Key Objectives:
1. Create a slick web app using a RESTful web API.
2. Secure things with an authentication protocol for different user levels.
3. Be mobile-friendly and browser-compatible.
4. Don't forget the security and privacy policies.

## Features to Knock Out:
- Account creation with local authentication (email, password, nickname).
- Limited perks for non-logged-in users.
- Hero search with soft-matching and nifty extras.
- Lists of public hero lists (with ratings) for everyone to see.
- Authenticated users can create and manage their hero lists.
- Admin superpowers to manage users, reviews, and copyright stuff.

## API and Tech Stack:
- Node.js for the backend.
- Front-end framework of choice: React
- Keep it clean, modular, and easily extensible.

## Security and Policies:
- Tight security policies and privacy terms (publicly accessible).
- DMCA notice & takedown policy (keep it accessible).
- Tools for the admin to handle copyright disputes like a superhero.
